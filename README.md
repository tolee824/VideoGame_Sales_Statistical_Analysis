To understand video game sales, I had to use data visualizations and sampling methods:

* Visualize game sales vs platform (gaming console)
* Determine if there is correlation between regional sales
* Figure out average critic's scores using various sampling methods
* Determine what are commonly used words in popular video game titles 


### Methods Used
